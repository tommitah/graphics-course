unzip glad.zip
inside there's three files: glad.c, glad.h and khrplatform.h

the header files should go to /usr/include/glad (fuck off windows)
be sure to check that all three files have consistent #includes (clangd-lsp should catch these)

that leaves the glad.c file, which can be included in the src

Compiling:
create a CMakeLists.txt file
create a build file
..../build cmake && make

To run:
./binary
