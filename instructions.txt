Running this requires binary packages that are packaged in the distro.
deps:
(Void) glfw, glfw-devel
(Ubuntu/other Debian) libglfw3 libglfw3-dev

unzip glad.zip
inside there's three files: glad.c, glad.h and khrplatform.h

the header files should go to /usr/include/glad
be sure to check that all three files have consistent #includes (clangd-lsp should catch these)

that leaves the glad.c file, which can be included in the src

Compiling:
create a CMakeLists.txt file
create a build directory
..../build cmake && make

To run:
./binary
